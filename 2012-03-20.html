 So now I am even
 <a href="http://blog.NetBSD.org/tnf/entry/new_netbsd_flyers_available">posting
  over at TNF</a>
 on <a href="http://blog.NetBSD.org/">blog.NetBSD.org</a>. Julian Fagir
 made new NetBSD flyers, and I committed them to the TNF website.
</p>

<p>I know that I should write more here but there is not much new on the
 MirBSD front.
</p>

<p>
 I updated the showcase to NetBSD-6_BETA on the Dom0, and now X refuses
 to start. Oh well. X does start when using a GENERIC kernel. This is
 very bad for showcase use, of course :(. pkgsrc is going into freeze
 very soon, and I did not do a whole lot of MirBSD fixes this time
 around. This is due to illness, searching for a new job, and working on
 <a href="http://golang.org/">the Go programming language</a>, which is
 expected to hit version 1.0 Real Soon Now(TM).
</p>

<p>
 I brushed up my Algorithms and Data Structures a bit by reading the
 third volume of TAOCP. Fantastic book.
